<h1>Jamaica Land of Beauty</h1>
<div><p><strong><em>Jamaica</em></strong> has an area of 4, 411 square miles of 11,424 square kilometers. The island is 146 miles (235km) long with widths varying between 22 (35km) miles. She is the third largest of the Caribbean islands and the largest of the English speaking islands.

Jamaica is a very mountainous country. Almost half of the island is above 1,000 feet (305m). Blue mountain Peak, the highest point, is 7,402 feet (2,256m) above sea level. The annual average rainfall is 78 inches (198cm). Because of the effects of the mountains, rainfall is fairly evenly distributed. Some hilly areas get nearly 300 inches (762cm) a year while parts of the western plains get as little as 30 inches (76.2).

The annual average temperature is 27ºC.  The hottest months are the in the summer and the winter months (December to March) are appreciably cooler. Areas of high altitude are also much cooler.  For example, the Blue Mountain Peak, has an average annual temperature of 13ºC. The tides around the coast hardly vary.  The difference between high and low tide is never more than 16 inches (41cm).</p></div><br><br>
